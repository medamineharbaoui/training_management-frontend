This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.15.
Angular 19 Application Setup

This guide provides simple steps to set up and run the Angular 19 application locally.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 10.x or higher
- Git

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medamineharbaoui/training_management-frontend
cd your-repo-name
```


### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required npm packages, using the legacy peer dependencies flag to handle compatibility:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the Angular development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`. Open this URL in your browser to view the app.

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependency Issues**: If `npm install` fails, ensure Node.js and npm versions are compatible with Angular 19.
- **Port Conflicts**: If port 4200 is in use, the server will prompt to use a different port.
